# CSAPP Lab

I am currently taking CS1502.01 in USTC. This is the repository for labs and reports.

Lab assignments can be found [here](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html).

Reports for each lab can be found in the corresponding report subdirectory.

My notes for this course will be updated on my personal [blog](https://xkz0777.github.io/).

Current progress: finishing datalab, working on bomblab.
